We've constructed and collected Python code to deal with lots of popular data sources.  We'll fix up this list as we go.  

#### Macro data 

FRED

WEO 

#### Survey data 

CPS

MEPS 


#### Data bootcamp

This was put together in conjunction with the Data Bootcamp course at NYU's Stern School of Business.  See the [course description and FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYvjgbeXk-BUGVrrVzJGqsaGaxYng1qSSB_3cxdsyJE/edit?usp=sharing).  

Another product of the #nyuecon Python factory @ NYU Stern.
