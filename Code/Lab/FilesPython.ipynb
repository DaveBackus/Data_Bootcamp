    "This notebook is going to help introduce how to work with text files in Python without relying on the underlying magic of `Pandas`. In addition to being interesting and useful in many cases, understanding what is happening behind the scenes inside `Pandas` can help you identify what may be going wrong if you run into trouble while reading csv or txt files.\n",

    "* First, we will show how to read a file into Python.\n",

    "## Interacting with Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the function `open` to open a file so that Python is able to see it. Many of the things that you are able to do to the file correspond directly to what you might do if you had opened the file in a text editor or in Excel. When you open a file, you will need to specify the level of access that you need to the file. Python has the following access levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading (`r`): Open the file with only enough permissions to read it. This is the default level of permission and will probably be the most used\n",
    "* Writing (`w` or `a`): Open the file with enough permissions for me to change the file.\n",
    "* Creating and Writing (`x`): Create a new file with the specified name and open it for me with write access.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you finish interacting with a file, it is important to remember to close it so that you don't accidentally do anything to the file after you're done with it. A workflow for interacting with a file should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do Stuff to file\n",
