"""
Messing around with World Bank data.  We start by reading in the whole WDI 
from the online csv.  Since the online file is part of a zipped collection, 
this turned into an exploration of how to handle zip files -- see Section 1.
Section 2 (coming) does slicing and plotting.  

Prepared for the NYU Course "Data Bootcamp."
