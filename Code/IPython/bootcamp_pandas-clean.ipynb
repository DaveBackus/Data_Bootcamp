    "# Pandas 2:  Cleaning data \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the best thing about Pandas is its extensive toolset for managing data.  Here we describe features of Pandas that allow us to clean data that, for reasons beyond our control, comes in a form that's not immediately amendable to analysis. This is the first of several such notebooks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Outline:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Want operator](#want).  Start with what we want to end up, then figure out how to get there.  \n",
    "* [String methods](#strings).  Fixing string variables, especially strings that should really be numbers.  \n",
    "* [Missing values](#missing).  Marking, dropping, counting missing values.    \n",
    "* [Selecting variables and observations](#selection).  Choose the variables and observations we want by their labels.\n",
    "* [Boolean selection](#boolean).  This is mostly what we do:  choose observations from conditions.  We use comparisons to produce Boolean variables and then use the Boolean variables to select observations that are `True`.  The next two methods extend this capability.  \n",
    "* [The `isin` method](#isin).  Choose observations whose values are in lists you specify. \n",
    "* [The `contains` method](#contains).  Flag observations that contain a specific piece of text.  Another string method, operates through Booleans.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "* [The `query` method](#query).  Similar capability using database syntax.  This is one of many examples in which **SQL database** tools have been built into Pandas.  \n",
    "--> \n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "* [Indexing](#index).  Setting and resetting the index.  Multi-indexes. \n",
    "* [Switching rows and columns](#pivot).  Transpose.  Pivot and melt.  \n",
    "* [Stack and unstack](#stack).  Managing column structure and labels.  Melt.  \n",

    "## Selecting variables and observations \n",
    "\n",
    "The word **selection** refers to choosing a subset of variables or observations using their labels or index.  Similar methods are sometimes referred to as **slicing**, **subsetting**, **indexing**, or **filtering**.  We'll treat the terms as synonymous.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways to do this.  Mostly we do \"Boolean\" selection, which we address in the next section.  We review more direct options here, mostly at high speed because they're not things we use much.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the outline below, `df` is a dataframe, `var` and `varn` are variable names, `vlist = ['var1', 'var2']` is a list of variable names, and `nlist = [0, 3, 4]` is a list of numerical variable or observation indexes, `n1` and `n2` are integers, and `bools` ia a list or pandas `Series` of booleans (`True` and `False`).  Some of the basic selection/indexing/slicing methods have the form:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* `df[var]` extracts a variable -- a series, in other words.\n",
    "* `df[vlist]` extracts a new dataframe consisting of the variables in `vlist`.  \n",
    "* `df[nlist]` does the same thing.  \n",
    "* `df[bools]`: extracts each _row_ where the corresponding element in `bools` is true. `len(bools)` must be equal to `df.size[0]`\n",
    "* `df[n1:n2]` extracts observations `n1` to `n2-1`, the traditional slicing syntax.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We find the last one confusing:  it extracts rows, not columns.  Pandas guru Wes McKinney notes: \"This might seem inconsistent to some readers.\"  Yup!  We don't do it much, partly for that reason.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- page 127 top -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas docs push the `loc` and `iloc` methods.  We'll ignore them -- we don't use them much -- but if you're interested, see [the docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing).    "
