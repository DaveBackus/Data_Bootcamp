# Import data into dataframe with read_csv:
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv')
#%%
# sanity check to make sure the import went through ok: 
df.head()
#%%
# look at column names (.tolist() isn't necessary but easier to read)
df.columns.tolist()

#%%
# just as an experiment, see what a simple graph might look like before we wrangle the data:
df.plot()
#%%
#  disaster. specify the x and y axis, and limit it to the 1st 10 (the df is already sorted by top median income by najor)
df[:10].plot(x='Major', y='Total')
#%%
# still really bad. 
# add rot to rotate the x-axis labels to make them easiery to read
df[:10].plot(x='Major', y='Total', rot=90)
#%%
# little better, but the default line graph is pretty meaningless. Make it a histogram:
df[:10].plot(x='Major', y='Total', kind='bar')
# notice that rot is gone - bar graphs will automatically rotate x labels to 90.
#%%
# add a title and a label for the y-axis:
ax = df[:10].plot(
    x='Major', 
    y='Total',  
    kind='bar',

#%%
# rather than clustered, stack them
# also, use colormap to change up colors
# http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html
# change kind='bar' to kind='barh' to make this a little easier to read
# since we're rotating this chart, change set_ylabel to set_xlabel

# sanity check. When looking at total, mechanical was greater than chemical, and the totals were near 100k. Something it wrong.
# add a column that adds men & women columns. This should equal the "total" column
