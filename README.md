### Data Bootcamp

---

A course exploring economic and financial data with Python at NYU's Stern School of Business.  For current information and links to course material, try the **[Data Bootcamp](http://databootcamp.nyuecon.com/)** website.  

---

*November 2015.*  We are offering two sections of **[Data Bootcamp](http://databootcamp.nyuecon.com/)** at NYU Stern in **Spring 2016**, one for undergrads (ECON-UB.0232, Tuesday and Thursday, 2-3:15, January 26 to May 10) and one for MBA students (ECON-GB.2313, Wednesday nights, 6-9pm, February 8 to May 9). They are standard for-credit courses at NYU.  

The course was developed by Stern faculty and students with the assistance and support of executives at **Amazon**.  The immediate goal is to train students to succeed as summer interns and full-time employees of technology companies, but the same skills are valued in finance, marketing, consulting, media, and other areas. We think of it as literacy for the modern age and a selling point in finding a job.   

More concretely, the course is designed to (i) introduce students to sources of economic, financial, and business **data** and (ii) give **programming newbies** a sense of how modern software -- in this case **Python** -- makes life easier and more interesting.  We'll let the data speak for itself.  But coding is an essential skill in the modern world. You can do lots of things in Excel, but if you value your time -- and you should -- you'll find you can use it more efficiently with a modern programming language.  We like to say we do it because we're **lazy**, laziness being a synonym here for efficiency.  Former students tell us it's become a key to success in the business world.  An alum with strong programming skills worries that this course will make him obsolete.   

The **[Data Bootcamp course](http://databootcamp.nyuecon.com/)** will **NOT** cover SQL databases.  **SQL Bootcamp** is a separate non-credit course.  Same team, same attitude, different content.  For more information, scroll down.  

You can find more information about the course on the **[course website](http://databootcamp.nyuecon.com/)**.  If you have questions, **email Dave Backus** (db3@nyu.edu) or track him down in his office (KMC 7-68) or at the Malt House.

We ran a non-credit mini-course in 2014 and plan another one for 2015.  The **2015 mini-course** will be held  

* Friday, **November 6**, 2-4pm.     
* Friday, **November 13**, 2-4pm.    

Both sessions will be in **Tisch UC-25** (the upper concourse, one floor below street level). **All welcome, no registration required**.  The sessions will give you a taste of the Python programming language and its capabilities for managing and graphing data.  We'll post **[more information](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Markdown/bootcamp_mini_2015.md)** as we develop it.  

The materials for the **Fall 2014 mini-course** are a little terse, and include mysterious notes to ourselves, but here they are:

**Our team.**  When we use the word "we" we have in mind the team of Dave Backus, Chase Coleman, Spencer Lyon, and Glenn Okun.  A number of students have helped out as well; see the acknowledgement in [our online book](https://davebackus.gitbooks.io/test/content/).

**Related courses.** Several students have asked how Data Bootcamp compares to other courses with significant programming content.  I've put together [a list](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Markdown/related_courses.md#related-courses), but I recommend you ask around.  Data Bootcamp does two things that are unusual:  it's newbie-friendly, and there's a strong emphasis on data.  The latter strikes me as important, in the sense that when you learn to program, it's helpful to have a purpose in mind.  Ours is to collect and manage data.  

**Suggestions welcome.**  Post them at the "Issues" link at the top (look for the exclamation point in a circle) or email Dave Backus at NYU:  db3@nyu.edu. Thanks in advance.

### SQL Bootcamp

Back by popular demand:  the second annual SQL Bootcamp @ NYU Stern.  This four-session Amazon-approved course is designed to get Amazon's summer interns up to speed so they can hit the ground running.  Others may find the same skill set useful.  Organized by Professors David Backus and Glenn Okun, the course is designed and delivered by MBA2 **[Sarah Beckett-Hile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahbecketthile)**.  
 
The 2016 edition of SQL Bootcamp consists of four mandatory sessions:  Fridays March 25, April 1, April 8, and April 15.  Each session will run from 1:30 to (approx) 4:30pm in room 3-65 of NYU's [Kaufman Management Center](http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/old_web/emplibrary/NYUSternLocation.pdf).  

If you are interested, please sign up for our **[Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp)** to get further information and announcements.  We expect to post **video** after each class, but are checking now to see whether we can make it accessible outside the school.  


<!--
#### Spring 2015 edition  

Professors David Backus and Glenn Okun proudly present the 2015 *NYU Stern School of Business SQL Bootcamp*. This five-session non-credit program will be taught by Sarah Beckett-Hile. It follows a popular
[Python mini-course](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp#data-bootcamp) run last fall.  

**Sessions.** Class sessions will be held on Fridays in KMC 5-90, 2pm to 5pm, starting March 27 and running through April 24.

**Before the first class.**  We will be using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.4. 
To install it on your computer, follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvZAEEh4MqpWfVuW1eW3lBvsS2yKEJXtzAkOZSrtd5s/edit?usp=sharing).
If you're stumped, come 30 minutes early to our first session.  

**Announcements.** If you want to get announcements about the class, please join our [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp), a Google Group devoted to this purpose.
You can ask questions there, too.  

**Materials.**  Also before the first class, you should download these documents and save them in a convenient folder/directory: 
* [Syllabus](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SBH_SQL_Syllabus.pdf)
* [IPython notebook](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SQL_Intro.ipynb) (essentially a combination of slides and code for the course) 
* [Python support code](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SQL_support_code.py) (you won't touch this, it runs behind the scenes, but you need it for the notebook to run) 
* [Cheat sheet](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SQL_Cheat_Sheet.pdf): this covers the whole course.  

Once you've done this: 
* Open Anaconda, then launch "ipython-notebook". This will open a window in your default browser where you can navigate your computer's local folders
* Locate and open the folder where you saved SQL_Intro.ipynb and SQL_support_code.py. 
* Click to open SQL_Intro.ipynb (you don't need to open SQL_support_code.py, just make sure it's in the same folder).

**Webinar.**  We have set up a "webinar" for people who cannot be here in person, 
including alums and other friends of the school.  Please register [here](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3554985340709263362) 
for SQL Bootcamp at NYU Stern School of Business. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email with information about joining the webinar.  The webinar gives you access to a live stream and the ability to ask questions.
