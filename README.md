### Data Bootcamp

The Data Bootcamp course at NYU Stern is designed to give (i) students some familiarity with economic and financial data and (ii) programming newbies a sense of how modern software makes life easier and more interesting.  We'll let the data speak for itself.  But on coding:  We think it's an essential skill in the modern world. You can do lots of things in Excel, but if you value your time -- we do! -- you'll find you can use it more efficiently with a modern programming language.  We like to say we do it because we're lazy, laziness being a synonym here for efficiency.  

We will offer two sections of the course in Spring 2016, one for undergrads (ECON-UB.0232, Tuesday and Thursday, 2-3:15, January 26 to May 10) and one for MBA students (ECON-GB.2313, Wednesday nights, 6-9pm, February 8 to May 9). You can find more information at  

* [Course description and FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYvjgbeXk-BUGVrrVzJGqsaGaxYng1qSSB_3cxdsyJE/edit?usp=sharing) 
* [Book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details) (first few chapters done, the others will be fleshed out between now and January 2016) 

If you have questions, email Dave Backus (db3@nyu.edu) or track him down in his office (KMC 7-68).  

**Mini-courses.**  We ran a non-credit mini-course in 2014 and plan another one for 2015. The mini-course will expose you to the Python programming language and illustrate its capabilities for managing data. Excel is a fine program, but once you learn to work with a modern programming language, it will remind you of doing arithmetic on your fingers.  Former students tell us it's become an essential business skill in asset management, tech, and marketing.  An alum with strong programming skills worries that this course will make him obsolete.  

The 2015 mini-course schedule is 

* Friday, November 6, 2-4pm.  Python fundamentals and an introduction to Python graphics.  You should follow [these instructions](https://davebackus.gitbooks.io/test/content/installing-python.html) to install Python before the class. If you have difficulty, come 20 minutes early and we'll get you going.      
* Friday, November 13, 2-4pm.  Accessing data from spreadsheets and internet sources, examples of what you will be able to do.  

We'll post additional information/material here as we develop it.  The materials for the Fall 2014 version are a little terse, and include mysterious notes to ourselves, but here they are: 

[Session 1](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Notes/mini_class1.pdf) | 
[Session 2](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Notes/mini_class2.pdf) | 
[Session 3](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Notes/mini_class3.pdf).

If you want to download the pdf files, click on the link, then the Raw button at the top.  The code files are imbedded in the pdfs, and also posted in the Code directory (scroll to the top of the page).  

**Suggestions welcome.**  Post them at the "Issues" link to the right (look for the exclamation point in a circle) or email Dave Backus at NYU:  db3@nyu.edu. Thanks in advance. 

**Licensing.** We encourage others to use this material and to acknowledge such use.
Here's [the boilerplate](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
On the off chance this crossed your mind, here's

### SQL Bootcamp

Professors David Backus and Glenn Okun proudly present the 2015 *NYU Stern School of Business SQL Bootcamp*. This five-session non-credit program will be taught by Sarah Beckett-Hile. It follows a popular
[Python mini-course](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/README.md#data-bootcamp) run last fall.  

**Sessions.** Class sessions will be held on Fridays in KMC 5-90, 2pm to 5pm, starting March 27 and running through April 24.

**Before the first class.**  We will be using the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.4. 
To install it on your computer, follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kvZAEEh4MqpWfVuW1eW3lBvsS2yKEJXtzAkOZSrtd5s/edit?usp=sharing).
If you're stumped, come 30 minutes early to our first session.  

**Announcements.** If you want to get announcements about the class, please join our [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nyu_data_bootcamp), a Google Group devoted to this purpose.
You can ask questions there, too.  

**Materials.**  Also before the first class, you should download these documents and save them in a convenient folder/directory: 
* [Syllabus](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SBH_SQL_Syllabus.pdf)
* [IPython notebook](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SQL_Intro.ipynb) (essentially a combination of slides and code for the course) 
* [Python support code](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SQL_support_code.py) (you won't touch this, it runs behind the scenes, but you need it for the notebook to run) 
* [Cheat sheet](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/SQL/SQL_Cheat_Sheet.pdf): this covers the whole course.  

Once you've done this: 
* Open Anaconda, then launch "ipython-notebook". This will open a window in your default browser where you can navigate your computer's local folders
* Locate and open the folder where you saved SQL_Intro.ipynb and SQL_support_code.py. 
* Click to open SQL_Intro.ipynb (you don't need to open SQL_support_code.py, just make sure it's in the same folder).

**Webinar.**  We have set up a "webinar" for people who cannot be here in person, 
including alums and other friends of the school.  Please register [here](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3554985340709263362) 
for SQL Bootcamp at NYU Stern School of Business. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email with information about joining the webinar.  The webinar gives you access to a live stream and the ability to ask questions.
