#### Announcements

We'll post announcements here.  

**Before the first session.** 
Please install the **Anaconda** distribution of **Python 3.4** from the download page: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>.  If you have trouble, read [this chapter](https://davebackus.gitbooks.io/test/content/installing-python.html), but keep in mind that the Anaconda download page has changed a little since it was written.  Or come 20 minutes early to the first session and we'll (try to) set you up.  

**Code used in class.**  Class 1 | Class 2  (coming!)

#### Outline

Where we're headed 
* Think of a picture you'd like to produce -- a "visualization" 
* And about what data you'll need 
* And about the coding skills to get there 

Rules to live by 
* **Ask for help**.  Raise your hand if you have a question, or don't follow what we're doing.  
* Develop your **Google fu**.  Learn to find answers to your questions with Google.   

**Skills** 

Why skills? 
* Businesses want people with skills (duh!) 

Why code? 
* One of the skills businesses value (not the only one) 
* Do things Excel can't do, and do them faster 

Why Python? 
* High-level language (simpler than C, C++, Java, etc) 
* User-friendly 
* Broad range of applications  
* Competitors:  Matlab, R; also Stata, SAS, etc.  

**Programming basics** 

Programming setups   
* Distribution (**Anaconda**)  
* Program (Python) 
* Environment:  editor or IDE (**Spyder**, Jupyter, Pycharm, many others) 

Spyder (start it up) 
* Editor 
* IPython console, object inspector    

Python basics
* Calculations, assignments, comments, strings and quotes, slicing, lists, built-in functions (print, type), objects and methods, tab completion, defining your own functions 

If you'd like to do more on your own:     
* Work your way through the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) course.  You can stop when you get to Advanced Topics.     
* Read the Python Fundamentals chapters of our  [Data Bootcamp book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details).
* Read Mevan's [wonderful guide](https://medium.com/keep-learning-keep-growing/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-code-af1a809457c7) "to the types of misconceptions and anxieties that people like me -- people newly learning to code -- may have."  

**Data and graphics** 

Packages 
* Add new functionality to core language 
* Our favs:  Pandas (data), Matplotlib (graphics)
* The `import` command

Data basics 
* `import pandas as pd` 
* Reading spreadsheets and csv files 
* Dataframes:  column labels, 
* Examples:  test file, IMDb, ... 
* Internet sources with APIs:  FRED, World Bank 
 
Graphics basics 
* `import matplotlib`
* Approach 1:  `plot(x,y)`
* Approach 2:  apply methods to `fig, ax` 
* Parameters and styles 
* Approach 3:  apply `plot` method to dataframe
