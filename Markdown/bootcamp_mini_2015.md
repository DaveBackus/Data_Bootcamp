### Data Bootcamp Mini-Course, 2015 edition  

A brief overview of the tools and skills you'll learn in **[Data Bootcamp](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp#data-bootcamp)**, a course at NYU's Stern School of Business. Developed by Dave Backus, Chase Coleman, Spencer Lyon, and Glenn Okun.  With the help and support of Sarah Beckett-Hile, Hersh Iyer, and executives at Amazon.  

November 6 and 13, 2-4pm, Tisch UC 25
* Session 1:  Python fundamentals, data management (Pandas)  
* Session 2:  graphics (Matplotlib), examples  

#### Before we start

Install the **Anaconda** distribution of **Python 3.4** from the download page: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>.  If you have trouble, read [this chapter](https://davebackus.gitbooks.io/test/content/installing-python.html), but keep in mind that the Anaconda download page has changed a little since it was written.  Or come 20 minutes early to the first session and we'll set you up.  

#### Outline

Big picture ideas to keep in mind 
* Become a magician:  “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” 
Data + Python = Magic!  
* Keys to success:  don't panic, ask for help 

**Skills** 

Why skills? 
* Businesses want people with skills (duh!) 

Why code? 
* One of the skills businesses value (not the only one) 
* Do things Excel can't do, and do them faster 

Why Python? 
* High-level language (simpler than C, C++, Java, etc) 
* User-friendly 
* Broad range of applications  
* Competitors:  Matlab, R; also Stata, SAS, etc.  

**Programming basics** 

Programming setups   
* Distribution (Anaconda)  
* Program (Python) 
* Environment:  editor or IDE (Spyder, Jupyter, Pycharm, many others) 

Spyder (start it up) 
* Editor 
* IPython console 
* More:  working directory, object inspector  

Python basics
* Calculations, assignments, strings and quotes, slicing, lists, built-in functions (print, type), objects and methods, tab complettion, functions

Following up.  If you'd like to learn more about core Python, work your way through the **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)** course.   Or the Python Fundamentals chapters of our  **[Data Bootcamp book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details)**.

**Data and graphics** 

Packages 
* Add new functionality to core language 
* Our favs:  Pandas (data), Matplotlib (graphics)
* The `import` command

Data basics 
* Reading spreadsheets and csv files 
* Dataframes:  column labels, 
* Examples:  test file, IMDb, ... 
* Internet sources with APIs:  FRED, World Bank 
 
Graphics basics 
* `import matplotlib`
* Approach 1:  `plot(x,y)`
* Approach 2:  apply methods to `fig, ax` 
* Parameters and styles 
* Approach 3:  apply `plot` method to dataframe
