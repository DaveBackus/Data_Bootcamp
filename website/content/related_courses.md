Includes hands-on examples, but is not primarily a coding course.  

**MKTG-GB.2344. Data-Driven Decision Making.**  "The course is designed to give you working knowledge of basic data analysis and statistical software, and to train you to deal with a wide spectrum of quantitative problems that you are likely to encounter in your workplace."  "Wokring knowledge of sotware" here does not include fundamental training. The [course website](http://www.d3mprof.com/) is a thing of beauty.
