# Data Bootcamp Topic Outline  


## Topic 2:  Python fundamentals 1


**Overview**

Where we're headed

* Think of a **picture** you'd like to produce -- a "visualization"
* And about what **data** you'll need
* And the **coding skills** to get there
* Examples:  [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/world/) | [cancer screening](http://www.vox.com/2015/10/28/9631500/does-mammography-work) | [Uber in NYC](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uber-is-serving-new-yorks-outer-boroughs-more-than-taxis-are/) | [mortality](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/29/1518393112.full.pdf) | [earthquake](https://jawbone.com/blog/napa-earthquake-effect-on-sleep/)   

Philosophy

* Target **coding novices**, no prior experience required or expected
* **Jump right in** the deep end of the pool, figure it out as we go
* Not a typical programming course:  cover only those aspects of Python relevant to data work

Rules to live by

* **Don't panic**.  The jargon and concepts will seem mysterious at first, but if you keep with it they'll start to make sense.  
* **One step at a time.**  We'll go as slowly as we need.  Speed is the enemy, it leads to mistakes.  
* **Doing is learning.**  We'll set you up to teach yourself.  If you're stuck, either **ask for help** or practice your **Google fu** and find the answer with Google.   

**Prelaunch checklist**

Install Anaconda

* Google "anaconda download"
* Download installer for **Python 3.5**
* Run installer

Locate this file in a browser

* Google "nyu data bootcamp" and follow links
* Or:  type in url at the top

Save today's code file in a handy place

* Create directory/folder `Data_Bootcamp`
* Click on code link above, then Raw button
* Save file in `Data_Bootcamp` directory

Launch

* Look for **Launcher** in your programs
* Start it up (takes a minute)
* Click on **Spyder** (another minute)

**Programming basics**

Our typical program

* Input data
* Manipulate data until it's in the form we want
* Produce a compelling graphic

Spyder basics  

* Editor
* IPython console, object inspector    

Python basics

* Calculations, assignments, comments, strings and quotes, lists, built-in functions (print, type), objects and methods, tab completion, getting help
