[Spring break, have fun]  


**March 22** <br> Recommended but not graded:  [Optional Code Practice A](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/IPython/bootcamp_practice_a.ipynb).


**March 29** <br> Exam (75 minutes, in class, open book, open internet if the wireless is up, bring one page of notes).  

**April 7** <br> Submit [Revised Project Ideas](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf). <br> (We're willing to let this slide till April 12.  The point is that you should start thinking about your project as soon as the exam is over.  But if you want to take another week to think about this, do it.) 
 

**April 19** <br> Submit [Project Proposal](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).  

**April 26.** Submit [Data Report](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).  This is really a little late; we urge you to think about data from the beginning. Ask for help if you're not sure you have what you need.  

**May 5** <br> Submit project by email to db3@nyu.edu. The subject line should be "bootcamp project ug".  The file name should be your last names separated by dashes and a short title;  eg, something like *Jones-Smith-Zhang-India.ipynb*. See [Project Guide](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf) for additional information.

We're willing to give you another week, but the absolute latest time a project can be submitted is **5pm May 13**.  No exceptions.  Keep in mind that this is the last possible time, not a target; you're more than welcome to submit your project earlier.  And honestly, you don't want this to drag on any longer than this.  

**There is no final exam.** If NYU schedules an exam time, which they sometimes do, we still won't have one.
