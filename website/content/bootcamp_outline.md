# Data Bootcamp: Topic list & links 


This is a list of topics for the NYU Stern course Data Bootcamp with links to material used in class.  We expect each topic to take roughly one week -- maybe a little more.

## Topic 1.  Data + Python = Magic!  

[Outline](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_topic_intro.pdf) | [Three ideas](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_3ideas.pdf) <br>
Examples:  [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/world/) | [Gender pay gap](http://esoltas.blogspot.com/2014/04/how-big-is-gender-pay-gap_10.html) | [Fertility](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/08/23/small-multiples-vs-animated-gifs-for-showing-changes-in-fertility-rates-over-time/) | [Uber in NYC](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uber-is-serving-new-yorks-outer-boroughs-more-than-taxis-are/) | [Vaccines](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/) <br> 
It's nice to have skills; installing Anaconda; Spyder and Jupyter/IPython; data; questions; idea machines.

## Topic 2.  Python fundamentals 1

Outline | Code <br> 
Calculations; assignments; strings; lists; built-in functions; objects; methods; tab completion.    

---
## Topic 3.  Python fundamentals 2

Outline | Code <br> 
True and False; comparisons; conditionals; slicing; loops; function definitions and returns; dictionaries and tuples. 

---
## Topic 4.  Data input:  Packages and Pandas

Outline | Code <br>
Packages; import; Pandas; csv files; reading csv/slx files; dataframes; columns; index; APIs.  

---
## Topic 5.  Python graphics:  Matplotlib fundamentals 

Outline | Code  <br>


---
## Topic 6.  Economic indicators 

Outline | Code  <br>

---
## Remaining topics will depend upon interest -- your and ours. We almost have enough for another course.  If there's something you'd particularly like to see, let us know.    

---
## Topic.  More Pandas

Outline | Code  <br> 
Pandas has incredible facilities for manipulating data, including many of the tools you'll find in databases.  We'll look at joins (merging data from different dataframes), groupbys (computing statistics for groups in a dataframe), and multi-indexed data (dataframes with more than two dimensions).  Incredibly useful for day-to-day work in business.

## Topic.  Updating and installing packages 

Outline <br> 
Using conda, pip, etc.  Applications to Anaconda, Seaborn, Quandl.  

---
## Topic.  Distributions, dependence, and dynamics 

Outline | Code  

This is really three topics.  

* Distributions is about the frequencies of various outcomes:  stock returns, incomes of individuals, medicial expenses, movie grosses.  Tools include histograms, smoothed versions (kde's), cumulative and log plots. 
* Dependence is about connections between two variables:  scatterplots, correlation, Anscombe's quartet. 
* Dynamics is about the relation between the same variable at two dates:  stock returns this month and next, cross-correlations, the ccf.

## Topic.  Demography & healthcare 

Outline | Code  <br>
The world is getting older -- a lot older.  Basic data for this involves the age distribution and the things that drive it:  mortality (people are dying less), fertility (and having few children).  All of this data is freely available.  <br>
Healthcare is closely related.  As people age, they consume more healthcare, which raises lots of questions about how to deliver and pay for it.

## Topic.  Statistics & Machine Learning 

Outline | Code  <br?
These are whole subjects, not topics, but we thought a brief overview of their history would be useful.  We combine it an an applications to multivariate regression with two packages, one from each.
