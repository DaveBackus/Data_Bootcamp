# Data Bootcamp: Topic list & links 


A list of topics with links to material used in class.  We expect each topic to take roughly one week -- maybe a little more. 

The topics in the first half follow **[THE BOOK](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details)**.  At the book link, click the large blue Read button to read online -- or download the pdf.  Both come with links.

**Summary:**  Three approaches to graphics: dataframe plot methods, plot(x,y), and fig/ax objects and methods; lines, scatters, bars, horizontal bars, styles.  

---
## Remaining topics will depend upon interest -- yours and ours. We have almost enough for another course.  If there's something you'd particularly like to see, let us know.

## Topic.  Economic indicators 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code | [Optional Code Practice A](https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_practice_x.pdf)  <br>
**Summary:**  Indicators of current economics conditions; indicators of country environments.  

---
## Topic.  More Pandas

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code <br> 
**Summary:**  Pandas has incredible facilities for manipulating data, including many of the tools you'll find in databases.  We'll look at joins (merging data from different dataframes), groupbys (computing statistics for groups in a dataframe), and multi-indexed data (dataframes with more than two dimensions).  Incredibly useful for day-to-day work in business.

## Topic.  Updating and installing packages 

**Handouts:**  Outline <br> 
**Summary:**  Using conda, pip, etc.  Applications to Anaconda, Seaborn, Quandl.  

---
## Topic.  Distributions, dependence, and dynamics 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br> 
**Summary:**  This is really three topics.  *Distributions* are about the frequencies of various outcomes:  stock returns, incomes of individuals, medicial expenses, movie grosses.  Tools include histograms, smoothed versions (kde's), cumulative and log plots. *Dependence* is about connections between two variables:  scatterplots, correlation, Anscombe's quartet, Simpson's paradox. *Dynamics* is about the relation between variables at two dates:  stock returns this month and next, cross-correlations, the ccf.

## Topic.  Demography & healthcare 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br>
**Summary:**  The world is getting older -- a lot older.  Basic data for this involves the age distribution and the things that drive it:  mortality (people are dying less), fertility (and having few children).  All of this data is freely available.  <br>
Healthcare is closely related.  As people age, they consume more healthcare, which raises lots of questions about how to deliver and pay for it.

## Topic.  Statistics & Machine Learning 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br>
**Summary:**  These are whole subjects, not topics, but we thought a brief overview of their history would be useful.  We combine it an application to multivariate regression with two packages, StatsModels (statistics) and Scikit-Learn (machine learning).
