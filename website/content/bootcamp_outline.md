# Data Bootcamp: Topic outlines & links 


A list of topics with links to material used in class.  We expect each topic to take roughly one week -- maybe a little more. 

The topics in the first half follow **[THE BOOK](https://www.gitbook.com/book/davebackus/test/details)**.  At the book link, click the large blue Read button to read online -- or download the pdf.  Both come with links.

## Remaining topics will depend upon interest -- yours and ours. 

We have almost enough for another course.  If there's something you'd particularly like to see, let us know.The plan is to mix data applications and tools in parallel.  The topics are generally shorter than before.

The next three topics provide some structure for thinking about data.  *Distributions* is about the frequencies of various outcomes:  stock returns, incomes of individuals, medical expenses, movie grosses.  *Dependence* is about connections between two variables, a connection often summarized (incompletely) byt their correlation.  *Dynamics* is about the relation between a variable at two different dates. Is strong economic growth followed by the same?  How do bond ratings evolve?  

---
## Topic.  Distributions 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br> 
**Summary:**  Some data is usefully described not by (say) its mean or median, but by its range of outcomes.  Examples include equity returns, the age distribution of the population, size of firms, and incomes of individuals.  We describe distributions with histograms, smoothed histograms (kde's), and so on.  We introduce the Numpy package along the way and use ipywidgets in Jupyter to add interactivity to our code.

## Topic.  Dependence

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br> 
**Summary:**

## Topic.  Dynamics 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br> 
**Summary:** 


<!--
:  scatterplots, correlation, contour plot, Anscombe's quartet, Simpson's paradox. 

:  stock returns this month and next, cross-correlations, the ccf.

## Topic.  Statistics & Machine Learning 

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br>
**Summary:**  These are whole subjects, not topics, but we thought a brief overview of their history would be useful.  We combine it an application to multivariate regression with two packages, StatsModels (statistics) and Scikit-Learn (machine learning).
