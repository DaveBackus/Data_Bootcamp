\centerline{\Large \bf Data Bootcamp:  Project Guide}
\centerline{Revised: \today}

\section*{Overview}

One of our goals is for you to produce a piece of work that you can use
to demonstrate your data and programming skill set to potential employers.
That work will come in the form of an IPython/Jupyter notebook,
a format that combines code, text, and graphics in one user-friendly document.
We will add them to our GitHub repository so that
you can use a link to show others what you've done.
You will also be able to see what your classmates have done.

The relative absence of structure in self-directed projects like this
makes them more challenging than most things you'll do in in school.
They also give you a chance to
follow your own interests and show off your creativity.

We have divided the project into a components to keep you on track.
The intent is to make the project easier, by breaking it down into a number
of small, manageable sub-projects.
The early steps are graded only on whether you do them:
you get 5 points if you do them, none if you don't.
We start with individual work.  Partway along, we encourage you to form groups
of two or three, but if you'd prefer to do this on your own,
that's ok, too.

The due dates for each one are posted on the course website.
{\bf Dates are firm and not open for negotiation.}


\section*{Project specifics}

The steps in the project production process are
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Three project ideas.}
Write down three project ideas in class.
One or two sentences each is enough.
Use your imagination.  Be creative.  Speak to others.
Write down things that interest you.
This will not be handed in or graded, but it will give you something to work with later on.

Over the coming weeks, we recommend you keep track of ideas --- {\bf and data sources\/} 
--- that cross
your mind as you prepare for further idea development.


\item {\bf Three revised project ideas.}
After giving this more thought, write down three project ideas in slightly more detail.
{\bf Include likely data sources.}
%Ask questions; we have a lot of experience with this, especially data.
All together this should be roughly one paragraph per idea and one page overall.
Like all work in this course, it should be clean and professional.
We will keep the copy you hand in to use in class, so keep a separate copy for yourself.

\item{\bf Project proposal.}
Form a group of two or three --- no more ---
and choose a single project from those you submitted ---
or perhaps some other idea if you get a sudden flash of inspiration.
Flesh out the project in more detail, including the source of data and
two figures you plan to produce with it.
Total length should be no more than two pages.

We stress:  you should {\bf be clear about the data} you plan to use.
If you can't get the data, that can derail your whole project.

{\bf Did we mention data?} 

\item {\bf Data report.}
Describe your data and how you accessed it in enough detail that someone else could do it.
Include your Python code.  % if you read it directly from an internet source.
Internet sources are preferred, because others can reproduce your results from your code.


\item {\bf Final project.}
You should submit your IPython notebook to \href{mailto:db3@nyu.edu}{db3@nyu.edu}
by the start of the last class.
The subject line should be:  ``bootcamp project ug'' or ``bootcamp project mba''
depending on the section you are in.
The file name should be your last names separated by dashes and a short title ---
something like {\tt Jones-Smith-Zhang-India.ipynb}.

Your project should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Title, list of authors, and summary.
\item Data entry.  Short description of data sources and code to read it
and reformat it as needed.
\item A series of figures that tell us something interesting.
Three or four would be enough, but do what you think best.
\end{itemize}
We'll post a template.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Free advice}

Some things to keep in mind:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Keep it simple.}
Most project ideas turn out to be too big.  You're generally well-advised
to carve out a manageable subset of what you think you can do.
There's no reason to worry about this at the idea generation stage,
but as you complete your project you may find that you need to focus
more narrowly on a part of it.

\item {\bf Find data.}  Make sure you can get the data you need.
One way to assure this is to start with data and ask what you can do with it.
Ideally you want the intersection (picture a Venn diagram) of an interesting
idea and good data.  You can start with either one, but ideas are often easier to
find than data.

\item {\bf Ask for help.}
We have years of experience with this kind of thing.
If you're stuck, let us know and we'll try to help.
You can also post a question on the class discussion board.
