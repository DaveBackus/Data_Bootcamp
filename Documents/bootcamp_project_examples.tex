\centerline{\Large \bf Data Bootcamp:  Project Examples}
\centerline{Revised: \today}

\medskip
If you're having trouble finding a project idea, here are some you could use or adapt.

\section{Prepackaged projects}

{\bf Business conditions.\/}  Describe current business conditions in the US.
(Most banks produce this kind of thing, you should be able to find examples.)
This might include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of indicators and why you think they're useful.
\item An assessment of the indicators:  either the correlation with industrial production
or some other quantitative measure of how closely it tracks the economy.
\item A summary of what your indicators overall suggest about the current state
of the US economy.
\end{itemize}
Chapter 11 of the \href{(http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/centers-of-research/global-economy-business/development-initiatives/global-economy-course}
{Global Economy book} has a nice overview of what's involved
and FRED codes for some popular indicators.

{\bf Emerging market opportunities.\/}


{\bf IPython notebook of data input chapter.\/}
Create a notebook that goes through the material of the data input chapter of the book,
or perhaps one of the other early chapters.
The result should be a notebook that allows others to teach themselves.
Include blank cells for exercises.
