If you're having trouble finding a project idea, here are some you could use or adapt.
Feel free to modify them in any way you find interesting.

\section*{Prepackaged projects} 

These are relatively well defined projects that extend things we've done in class.  
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Current economic conditions.\/}  Describe current business conditions in the US.
(Most banks produce this kind of thing, you should be able to find examples.)
This might include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of indicators and why you think they're useful.
\item An assessment of the indicators:  either the correlation with industrial production
or some other quantitative measure of how closely it tracks the economy.
\item A summary of what your indicators overall suggest about the current state
of the US economy.
\end{itemize}
Chapter 11 of the \href{(http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/centers-of-research/global-economy-business/development-initiatives/global-economy-course}
{Global Economy book} has a nice overview of what's involved
and FRED codes for some popular indicators.
You can find more indicators --- and descriptions --- 
on the
\href{http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar}{Bloomberg economic calendar}.

\item {\bf Emerging market opportunities.\/}  An assessment of 
(long-term) business conditions
in two or three emerging market economies.
Here are a couple examples from the Global Economy course:
\href {https://github.com/DaveBackus/Global_Economy/blob/master/Cases/case_foxconn.pdf}
    {Foxconn's Next Frontier}
and \href
    {https://github.com/DaveBackus/Global_Economy/blob/master/Cases/case_ghana.pdf}
    {Opportunity in Ghana}.
In each one, we take a business proposition (start business X)
and assess the relevant aspects of the business climate in two or three countries.
The World Bank's 
\href{http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/}{Open Data Blog} is a good source of 
similar policy-related ideas.  


Key data sources for this kind of work:  
\begin{itemize} 
\item The World Bank's \href{http://data.worldbank.org/}{Open Data Portal} is a good place
to start.  A large collection of social, political and economic data for a broad
range of countries. 

\item The World Bank also has (separate) databases related to 
\href{http://www.doingbusiness.org/}{Doing Business} 
and 
\href{http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home}
{Governance Indicators}. 

\item The \href{http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/}{Penn World Table} 
has data on GDP, employment and hours worked,
and capital.  

\item The World Economic Forum does not produce its own data, 
but their 
\href{http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/}
{Global Competitiveness Report} 
has a good summary of information from other sources.  
\end{itemize} 

\item {\bf Demographics.\/} Delve deeper into the population dynamics of a country
you find interesting, or compare two or three countries.
You could start with our
\href{https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Lab/UN_demography.ipynb}
{demography notebook},
where we explore UN data on
the age distribution of the population, life expectancy, mortality (deaths), and fertility (births).

One example:  Look at the data for China, see where it leads you.  

Another one:  Anne Case and Angus Deaton generated a lot of discussion, 
and some controversy, when they documented an increase in mortality of middle-aged white men in the US
and their causes of death, including suicide and drug overdose.

\end{itemize} 
Can you reproduce their work?  Extend it?  Take it in a different direction?
\end{itemize}


\section*{Data and package projects}


Here the idea is to describe a dataset or a package.
Why stop there?  Because enough is enough!  But if you do this and still have time
for more, feel free to keep going. 
And {\bf if you get stuck, ask for help}.     
\begin{itemize} 

\item {\bf Describe a package.\/}
Take a package we haven't used and write a tutorial that explains to others how to install
and use it.  Some examples that have come up in class:  

\begin{itemize} 
\item \href{http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/}
{Beautiful Soup} is for ``scraping''  websites.  
The term refers to grabbing data that is posted online but not in a user-friendly format.
We can still grab it with the right tools and a little understanding of the structure
of websites.  

\item \href{http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html}{Bokeh} does interactive web graphics.
Spencer's a big fan.
One option is to take some graphics we've done in class and redo them in Bokeh,
illustrating its capabilities.

\item \href{https://github.com/quantopian/zipline}{Zipline} is an 
``algorithmic trading library.''

\item \href{https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib}{TA-lib} 
``performs technical analysis with financial market data.''
\end{itemize} 


\item {\bf Describe a dataset.\/}
Take a dataset you find interesting.  Write code that reads it into Pandas
and explain to others how the data might be used. 
See the course \href{}{data page}
for examples.
If this sounds insufficiently ambitious, keep in mind that some of these datasets 
are pretty complicated.  

We have a growing collection of examples, which could serve as your starting point:
\begin{itemize}
\item MEPS.  The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey covers medical expenditures for individuals.   
This \href{http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/DataBrief3 Final.pdf}{short report} illustrates its potential.
Figure 1, specifically, shows that 22 percent of total expenditures come
from 1 percent of individuals.  
(Think about that for a minute.) 
Brian LeBlanc has reproduced this figure from the raw data in an 
\href{https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Lab/MEPS_data_experiment_Brian.ipynb}
{IPython notebook}.  

\item SCF.  The Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances collects data every three to five years
on household income and (especially) assets and liabilities.  
It's a great resource for things like student loan debt, the wealth distribution, 
and many other things.  
Here's a 
\href{http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/08/14/431263285/13-years-of-american-credit-cards-in-one-graph}
{nice application}
to credit card debt and interest rates.
And 
\href{https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/blob/master/Code/Lab/SCF_data_experiment_Brian.ipynb}
{Brian LeBlanc's notebook}


\item Chase likes this collection of \href{http://insideairbnb.com/index.html}{Airbnb data}
and is trying to figure out what to do with it.  If you have ideas, get in touch.  
\end{itemize} 

If you have your own ideas, all the better.  Or skim the programs in our 
\href{https://github.com/DaveBackus/Data_Bootcamp/tree/master/Code/Lab}{Lab directory}.  
(Some of them are works in progress.)  
Or our 
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2ZDKFyyqfOrCGbNcCIE9mmgap4tjkTNuw32hK4c6BI/edit?usp=sharing}
{sources and apps} collection.  


\begin{comment} 
\item {\bf IPython notebook of data input chapter.\/}
Create a notebook that goes through the material of the data input chapter of the book,
or perhaps one of the other early chapters.
The result should be a notebook that allows others to teach themselves.
Include blank cells for exercises.
